This is my final year game engine that was made from a template on http://www.rastertek.com/ in my second year.
it uses a leap motion for input and has implemeted a gameobject componet system.

Quick Look Guid:
LeapTestScene.cpp/h //shows streamling of update and render calling
GameObject.cpp/h //Gamobject implemtation
DebugDesplay.cpp //Shows events, UI implemtation


TODO:

Would like to do:
Serilize Gameobjects and componets
